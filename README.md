# cache-movies-manager

Haskell implementation of the cache for movies. This application imports the movies from the source of truth and serves them while waiting for messages to add tags.
Work paused. The rest service, import phase and message receiver work, the update of movies with new tags remains to be implemented.

Run me with :
stack exec cache-movies-manager-exe
